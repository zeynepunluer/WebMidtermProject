I created a web page for "Community Bank". This web page has left and right sidebars and a main page which corresponds to the middle part of the page. 
I kept all of these features in a main-container to manage the locations and styling of these components.

In the left sidebar, we have user icon and username under the icon. Below, we have icons for home, withdraw, deposit etc. I kept the icon images in icon-container.
Also we have strings, I kept them in string-box to easily control the styling.
Finally at the bottom we have exchange rates. These exchange rate texts display in a box.



In the right sidebar, first we have quick transfer part, and below, we have due dates part. All the features in these two sections display in box-structure. I explained these structures in the code. After we have a section for receiving message from the user. I created form structure to achieve this part.

In the main part, we have user's cards visually. Under that, we have recent activity section and total savings graphic next to it. I kept these two in "graphic-container" to place them side by side. After, we have advertisements section. I create two boxes and put some quotes on them to promote Community Bank. I also created "commercial-container" to put these three boxes in, and place them side by side.


Finally, we have a footer at the downmost of the page. 
I created "link-box" class and use it three times in "link-"container" so I have three sections side by side, and the links placed column wise in these three link-boxes.
